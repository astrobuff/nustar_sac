# Analysis of solar NuSTAR data with SSWIDL

This includes, loading the data, mapping it, spectral fitting with [OSPEX](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/packages/spex/doc/ospex_explanation.htm) (part of SSW).

At the moment it is mostly just loading in the spectral file (.pha) and response files (.rmf .arf) and then doing spectral fititng with OSPEX.
