# Analysis code for solar NuSTAR data

This repository shows code for the analysis of NuSTAR solar data, in terms of maps and spectral fitting etc. This is done using the outputs from HEASOFT's nupipeline and nuproducts, mostly in SSWIDL and a bit in XSPEC. At the moment, the code mostly is on spectral fitting in OSPEX (SSWIDL) and XSPEC.

For python things, there will be a few example notebooks here but mostly have a look at the [NuSTAR PySolar repo](https://github.com/NuSTAR/nustar_pysolar).

### Requirements

For this to work you are going to need some (if not all) of the following installed:

* [HEASoft with the NuSTAR and XSPEC packages](http://heasarc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/download.html)
* The latest [NuSTAR Calibration Files](http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/nustar/)
* [SAOImage DS9](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html)
* [IDL with SSWIDL](http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/ssw_setup.html)

### Creating NuSTAR spectral files

Need to write some things here.....
